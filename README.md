# Lottie-Like

## What does it do?

This project is a short demonstration and implementation of [Lottie.js](https://airbnb.io/lottie/web/web.html)

> "Lottie is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images."

The webpage contains a like button that originates as a Font Awesome heart icon. 
Upon user click, the icon is hidden and a microinteraction of a heart popping plays with some confetti in the background.
